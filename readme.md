# Findthe median of two sorted arrays
# step 1
1. use push comments for merging two arrays in for loop
2. then arrange ascending order 
# step 2
1. after making single array find the length of array
2. Length is even number then use below formula
    a[((length/2)+((length/2)-1)/2)]
3. length is odd 
    a[((length-1)/2]
